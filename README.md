## Usage
Staking bots are automated tools designed to simplify the process of staking cryptocurrency assets to earn rewards. In the realm of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) projects, staking bots serve to incentivize both NFT holders and project administrators by enabling the earning of additional tokens or benefits through staking their NFTs.

**For NFT Holders:**

1. **Staking NFTs:** NFT holders utilize the staking bot to lock their NFTs into a smart contract for a specified period. Staking NFTs often results in benefits such as earning project tokens, gaining governance rights, or accessing exclusive content.

2. **Earning Rewards:** By staking their NFTs, holders earn rewards based on the duration and quantity of tokens staked. These rewards can include project tokens, NFT airdrops, or other project-specific perks.

3. **Participating in Governance:** Some projects use staking to grant voting rights in governance matters. NFT holders who stake their tokens can participate in decisions such as protocol upgrades or feature additions.

**For Project Administrators:**

1. **Configuring Staking Rules:** Administrators define the staking rules, including duration, reward structures, and eligibility criteria. They collaborate with developers to integrate the staking bot into the project's ecosystem.

2. **Monitoring Staking Activity:** Administrators use the staking bot's dashboard or analytics tools to monitor staking activity, helping them gauge program popularity and make informed decisions.

3. **Adjusting Staking Parameters:** Based on project goals and community feedback, administrators can tweak staking parameters such as reward rates, durations, or eligibility criteria to optimize program effectiveness and community engagement.

In conclusion, staking bots empower NFT holders to earn rewards and actively participate in projects, while administrators leverage them to enhance user engagement, incentivize staking, and refine project economics. Specific use cases and scenarios vary based on project objectives and implemented bot features.

## Configuration

**1. Choose the Staking Token:**
   - Decide which Solana-based token users will stake. This can be the project's native SPL token or any other SPL token on the Solana blockchain.

**2. Set the Staking Duration:**
   - Determine the minimum and maximum staking durations for Solana-based tokens. Specify the locking periods for staked tokens.

**3. Define Eligibility Criteria:**
   - Specify eligibility criteria for staking. Determine whether users need to own a specific type of Solana-based NFT, meet certain rarity criteria, or hold a minimum amount of tokens to participate.

**4. Establish Staking Limits:**
   - Decide if there will be any limits on the number of NFTs or tokens a user can stake simultaneously. Set minimum and maximum staking amounts.

**5. Rewards Structure:**
   - Configure how users will be rewarded for staking their NFTs or tokens. Consider the following components:
   
   - **Reward Tokens:** Identify which Solana-based tokens users will earn as rewards. This can be the project's native token or other tokens on the Solana blockchain.
   - **Reward Rate:** Specify the rate at which rewards are distributed. This can be a fixed amount per day or a percentage of the staked tokens.
   - **Vesting Period:** Decide if rewards should have a vesting period before they can be claimed. Vesting ensures that users remain staked for a certain duration.
   - **Multiplier or Bonus:** Implement additional rewards for specific actions or conditions, such as early staking or long-term commitment.
   - **Referral Rewards:** Create a referral program to incentivize users to invite others to stake their Solana-based NFTs or tokens.
